# Box Algebra

Box Algebra is a new way of understanding what arithmetic, and much of associated mathematics, is actually truly about. The most important new understandings are that

1. the most powerful data structure for foundational work is not a set, and is not a list, but is rather a multiset, where elements are unordered and repetitions are allowed
2. the particle / anti particle duality famously discovered by Paul Dirac in 20th century physics has a deep and remarkable analog in the foundations of arithmetic.

When we put these two together, we get Box Arithmetic.

This crate defines the fundamental data structure, a mathematical box, and associated methods for doing basic algebraic operations.

The idea of Box Algebra and its arithmetic is being developed by Norman J. Wildberger.
He introduces the basic concepts and their applications in a Youtube video series which started in 2022:
